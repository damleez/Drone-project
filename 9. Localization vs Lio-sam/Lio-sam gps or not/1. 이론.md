### 1. Lio-sam GPS ON 
- In [Lio-sam github](https://github.com/TixiaoShan/LIO-SAM)
```
Using GPS: The park dataset is provided for testing LIO-SAM with GPS data.
This dataset is gathered by Yewei Huang. To enable the GPS function, change "gpsTopic" in "params.yaml" to "odometry/gps".
In Rviz, uncheck "Map (cloud)" and check "Map (global)". Also check "Odom GPS", which visualizes the GPS odometry.
"gpsCovThreshold" can be adjusted to filter bad GPS readings. "poseCovThreshold" can be used to adjust the frequency of adding GPS factor to the graph.
For example, you will notice the trajectory is constantly corrected by GPS whey you set "poseCovThreshold" to 1.0.
Because of the heavy iSAM optimization, it's recommended that the playback speed is "-r 1".
